# TWoW_HarpBreakers

This script is a QoL improvement to the classic World of Warcraft server “TurtleWow”.

> There will be more features and improvements over time.
> 

Currently the script takes “preset addons” and installs them for you, no matter where on your C: drive you put Turtle WoW (aside from some particular system directories)

# Included addons

- pfQuest
- pfQuest-turtle
- ShaguDPS
- TWThreat
- AtlasLoot
- Cartographer
- SortBags
- Cleanup (currently broken)
