# ShaguDPS

A very small and lightweight damage meter. The combat log is parsed in a locale-independent way and should work on every 1.12 (vanilla) and 2.4.3 (burning crusade) based client.

The goal is not to compete with the big players like [DPSMate](https://github.com/Geigerkind/DPSMate) or [Recount](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/recount),
but instead to offer a simple damage tracker, that is fast and uses the least amount of resources as possible.

**So don't expect to see anything fancy here.**
